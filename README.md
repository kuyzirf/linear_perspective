# Linear perspective


This script draws a square (or another shape defined by four points) in three-dimensional space and then shows how it would look if it were photographed or drawn with linear perspective.

Another script does the same with a cube. You only need to introduce the center of the cube and three rotation angles (see Euler angles)
